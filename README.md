## GAN
## WGAN
Training WGANs does not require maintaining a careful balance in training of the discriminator and the generator, and does not require a careful design of the network architecture either.
In this paper, an example is given to illustrate simple sequences of probability distributions converge under the EM distance(or Wasserstein-1) but do not converge under the other distances
and divergences which are TV, KL and JS distances and divergences.
